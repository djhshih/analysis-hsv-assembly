# Notes from Cole Peters

The herpes simplex virus is dsDNA, HSV1 F strain.

Reference genome: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/290766003?report=graph

F6: only has beta-galactosidase (E. coli) insert (~2800 bp) halfway through the Ul39 gene.
G207: made from F6; has ICP34.5(RL1) deletion (should be present 2x in the genome)
G47: 2 deletions of 34.5 as well, same b-gal insert, deletion of Us12
G47-BAC: same as virus just with bacterial sequence (10kb extra)
Vero: host cells
